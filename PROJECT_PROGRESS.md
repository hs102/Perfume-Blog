## Database Relationships to Implement

### User → Brand (One-to-Many)
```javascript
// When creating a brand:
user.brands.push(newBrand._id);
await user.save();

// When deleting a brand:
user.brands.pull(brandId);
await user.save();
```

### User → PerfumeReview (One-to-Many)
```javascript
// When creating a review:
user.reviews.push(newReview._id);
await user.save();

// When deleting a review:
user.reviews.pull(reviewId);
await user.save();
```

### Brand → PerfumeReview (One-to-Many)
```javascript
// When deleting a brand, handle associated reviews:
await PerfumeReview.deleteMany({ brandId: brand._id });
```
