## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with express-session
- User-specific routes require authentication middleware
- Authorization checks to ensure users can only edit/delete their own content

### Database Design
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Proper references between collections
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (user IDs, brand IDs)

### User Experience
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Intuitive navigation
- Clear feedback for user actions
- Form validation and error handling

### Code Organization
- MVC pattern (Models, Views, Controllers)
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- Modular route handlers
- Reusable view components (EJS partials)
